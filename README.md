# Hangman

This game is just like a game of hangman, one you might have played as a kid, or with your kids.

The user will see underscores with the amount of letters in the randomly chosen word. 

To begin, the user simply needs to press and alphabetic number and it will either appear as a correct guess and populate one of the underscores, or it will be places in the guessed letters list.

The game is playable multiple times weather the user correctly guesses the word with the alloted number of lives, or not.
